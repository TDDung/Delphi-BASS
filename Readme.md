Delphi's FMX and VCL header/wrapper units for BASS audio library plus add-ons

Hi,

Based on published free header/wrapper units of BASS audio library plus add-ons on www.un4seen.com, I have improved, modified and added more codes to ensure they work with all platforms that Delphi's FireMonkey and VCL frameworks support. I also collected, intensively tested and structured the libraries into a package for Delphi programmers to use with a very detailed guide accompanied. Finally I also included a simple but sufficiently complete demo project.

I have seen so many questions on BASS forums as well as other forums regarding audio for Delphi so I just thought I could share my work. That's all my intention.

Brief description about BASS audio library
------------------------------------------
(See more in www.un4seen.com)

BASS is an audio library for use in software on several platforms. Its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample, stream (MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG, WAV, AIFF, custom generated, and more via OS codecs and add-ons), MOD music (XM, IT, S3M, MOD, MTM, UMX), MO3 music (MP3/OGG compressed MODs), and recording functions. All in a compact DLL that won't bloat your distribution.
BASS is also available for the Android, iOS, UWP, WinCE, and ARM Linux platforms.

Note: All the binaries of BASS audio library plus add-ons (*.dll, *.so, *.a and *.dylib) can be downloaded directly from www.un4seen.com instead. There are just many of them, though, so just make sure you choose the correct ones to replace what's in my package and of course test, test and test :-)
